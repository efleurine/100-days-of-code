### Day 1: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the random quote project in the Free Code Camp Frontend curriculum

**Thoughts:** The design is far from perfect. But I learn to move forward, I forced myself to towards the finish line. The most important certificate will be the front-end certificate because I am so good in design and I always struggle and to often stop because I feel my design too lousy but what instead of being paralyzed by that I want to use it as an opportunity to improve myself. So I will extensively read about design for the next 100 days.

### Day 2: July 1, 2017


**Today's Progress**: It has been a while since I did the first day but I am happy that I was able to move forward. Today was about a very basic and simple to-do in react.

**Thoughts:** I did a very simple to-do list in react. You can only add item and mark them as completed. Kept it simple but functional and doing progressive enhancement are the most important lessons I want to get out of this 100 days of code. Too often I trying to get to the final line right from the beginning while I could accept doing it step by step.
