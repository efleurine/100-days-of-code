# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2017


**Today's Progress**: I have completed the random quote project in the Free Code Camp Frontend curriculum

**Thoughts:** The design is far from perfect. But I learn to move forward, I forced myself to towards the finish line. The most important certificate will be the front-end certificate because I am so good in design and I always struggle and to often stop because I feel my design too lousy but what instead of being paralyzed by that I want to use it as an opportunity to improve myself. So I will extensively read about design for the next 100 days.
